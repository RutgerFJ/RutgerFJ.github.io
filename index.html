                <p>
                    I have a passion for people, programming and sports.
                    Currently, I'm studying and working at the University of Applied Sciences in Leiden.
                    In my free time, I like cycling and weightlifting. Since 2023 I've also been exploring web
                    development.
                    Take a look at the <a href="#projects" class="highlight un">projects</a> I've been working on!

                    <p>
                        My first Django application. After using Strava to track my sports activities for about 3 years,
                        I
                        longed for a better way to visualize my activities. Hence the name "Stravis". The application
                        allows
                        users to connect to their Strava account, download their activities and creates multiple
                        customizable
                        plots.

                    <p>
                        The final Django project made for my Minor Application Development during my study. In a group
                        of 3,
                        we
                        worked with an external client to create a web application that handles grade administration for
                        students.
                        The client had a lot of specific requirements, which no other grade administration system
                        satisfied.
                        I was primarily responsible for communicating with the client and leading meetings, which I
                        thoroughly
                        enjoyed!

                    <p>
                        This application was part of my Minor Application Development during my study. Our group of 4
                        students
                        worked with another group of students as a client. The client tasked us with creating a wrapper
                        for
                        NCBI's BLAST (a bio-informatics tool). The application allowed users to store their BLAST
                        queries
                        and
                        results, aswell as share them with other users.

                        The application that made me fall in love with web development! The application is very simple,
                        allowing
                        the user to connect to a PostgreSQL database and download clusters of orthologous genes (COGs).
                        The
                        application visualizes these clusters and allows filtering, so the user can select clusters that
                        they
                        deem interesting.
